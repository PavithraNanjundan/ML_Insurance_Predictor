Insurance Charges Prediction Model ðŸš€
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict insurance charges based on user 
input parameters like age, BMI, number of children, and smoker status. The model was trained 
using regression techniques and deployed as a Flask API within a Docker container. It is hosted 
on Hugging Face, allowing seamless interaction through API requests. This end-to-end pipeline 
demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, containerization, and deployment, making it a
practical example of ML in production. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
